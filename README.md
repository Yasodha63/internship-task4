# 🚧 Traffic Accident Data Analysis – Task 04

This project is part of my internship tasks and focuses on analyzing traffic accident data to identify patterns based on weather, road conditions, time of day, and accident hotspots.

---

## 📌 Task Objective

- Analyze accident data to find common contributing factors.
- Understand the impact of:
  - Weather conditions
  - Road surface types
  - Time of day (day/night)
- Visualize accident trends and hotspots.

---

## 🗃️ Dataset Information

The dataset contains traffic accident data with the following sample columns:

- `Severity` – Level of accident impact  
- `Weather_Condition` – Weather at the time of the accident  
- `Road_Condition` – Type of road surface  
- `Time_of_Day` – Whether the accident happened during day or night  
- `Accident_Location` – Area or location of the accident (city/region)

## 📊 Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📈 Visualizations Created

- Bar chart: Number of accidents under different weather conditions  
- Count plot: Accidents during day vs night  
- Bar chart: Accidents by road surface condition  
- Pie chart: Accident severity levels  
- Optional: Accident hotspots (if location data available)

## 🧹 Steps Performed

1. Loaded and explored the dataset.
2. Cleaned any missing or inconsistent data.
3. Grouped data to analyze trends.
4. Visualized results to identify patterns.
